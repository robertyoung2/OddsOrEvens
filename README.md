# OddsOrEvens
Project written in Java based on Microsoft DEV276x Project 2. Here's a clip of the game being played that the project is based on: https://youtu.be/4ZOLs03vILs?t=1m
The source code for my completed implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/robertyoung2/OddsOrEvens/blob/master/src/OddsOrEvens.java).

The project is comprised of the three following sections:

### Part 1 - Pick odds or evens

1. Ask the user for their name and then use a scanner to let them type their name into the console.
2. Now greet the user and ask them to choose either odds or evens. Use a scanner to let them type in either "O" or "E".
3. Using an if/else statement print out whether the user chose "odds" or "evens".

### Part 2 - Play the Game

1. Ask the user how many "fingers" they are going to play, and let them enter in a number.
2. Let the computer choose a random number to represent their fingers
3. Determine what the results are. 

### Part 3 - Who won?

Using if/else statements, determine who the winner is.
